            <h3>The History of Coffee</h3>
            <p>The story of coffee begins in the 9th century in **Ethiopia**, where legend tells of a goat herder named **Kaldi** who discovered the stimulating effects of coffee beans. Kaldi noticed that his goats became energetic after eating the red cherries from a particular plant, which was later identified as **Coffea arabica**. This discovery led to the use of coffee in religious rituals and eventually spread across the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
            
            <p>By the **15th century**, coffee was being brewed in **Yemen** and became an integral part of the **Arabian** culture. Coffeehouses, known as **qahveh khaneh**, began to emerge in the Ottoman Empire, where they became hubs for intellectual conversation and social interaction.</p>
            
            <p>The beverage spread to Europe in the **17th century** and was embraced by the intellectual and social elites, particularly in **London**, where the first coffeehouse opened in **1652**. Over the next few centuries, coffee made its way to the Americas, with **Brazil** becoming a key producer of coffee by the **19th century**.</p>
            
            <p>In the **20th century**, coffee evolved into a global commodity with innovations such as the espresso machine and instant coffee. Today, coffee culture is widespread, with countless varieties of coffee beverages enjoyed worldwide, from espresso and lattes to cold brews and more.</p>
            
            <p>At Coffee Haven, we take pride in being part of this rich history, offering you a taste of the finest coffee beans and blends from around the world.</p>
